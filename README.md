# AUV-Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle-Six-DOF-Simulation
6DOF (Six Degrees Of Freedom) simulation of an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) with rate feedback PID controllers for low-level pitch and yaw dynamics, 
Runge-Kutta integrator, developed in Python
It can be easily changed to develop advanced GNC algorithms
